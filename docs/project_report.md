# Edge-Fog Computing Task Offloading System
## Project Report

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The rapid expansion of IoT devices has led to unprecedented data generation, requiring efficient processing mechanisms. Traditional cloud-centric approaches suffer from high latency and bandwidth constraints, making them unsuitable for time-sensitive applications. Edge and fog computing paradigms address these limitations by bringing computation closer to data sources, but require intelligent task offloading strategies to optimize performance.

### 1.2 Research Paper Selection

This project implements a proof-of-concept based on the research paper:

**"A novel approach for IoT tasks offloading in edge-cloud environments"** (2021) from the Journal of Cloud Computing.

The paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach for task offloading in edge-cloud systems to minimize service time for latency-sensitive applications. The authors address the challenge of efficiently distributing computational tasks across IoT devices, edge nodes, and cloud resources while considering application characteristics, resource utilization, and resource heterogeneity.
